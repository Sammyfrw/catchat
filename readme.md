CatChat: get a name, get a key, chat!
--------------------------------------

CatChat is a very simple chat application built using Ruby on Rails,
PostgreSQL and JQuery. It features websockets built using Pusher.

It is built for ease of use from the user point of view. It features user-
created rooms that can be assigned a pass-key, and when completed, users are
able to share the pass keys to allow authenticated users or guests to enter
and begin chatting.

Its lightweight design allows more features to be added or current features to
be edited with minimal hassle in the future.
